## Pointer Expressions and Pointer Arithmetic

Pointers are valid operands in arithmetic expressions, assignment expressions, and comparison expressoins. However, not all arithmetic operators are valid with pointer variables. This section describes the operators that can have pointer as operands, and how these operators are used.

### 7.8.1 Pointer Arithmetic Operators
The following arithmetic operations are allowed for pointers:
    - incrementing (++) or decrementing (--)
    - adding an integer to a pointer (+ or +=)
    - subtracting an integer froma pointer (- or -=), and
    - subtracting one pointer from another - meaningful only when both pointers point into the same array.
